        You want me to tell you something?
        Uh, huh
        I know what you wanna hear
        
        I know you want me, baby
        I think I want you too
        (I think I love you, baby)
        I think I love you too
        I'm here to save you, girl
        Come be in Shady's world
        I wanna grow together
        Let's let our love unfurl
        
        You know you want me, baby
        You know I want you too
        They call me Superman
        I'm here to rescue you
        I wanna save you, girl
        Come be in Shady's world
        (Oh, boy, you drive me crazy)
        Bitch, you make me hurl
        
        They call me Superman
        Leap tall hoes in a single bound
        I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
        I'll never let another chick bring me down
        In a relationship, save it, bitch!
        Babysit? You make me sick
        Superman ain't savin' shit
        Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
        
        Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
        I'll tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
        Play no games, say no names
        Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
        I'm a different man, kiss my ass
        Kiss my lips, bitch, why ask?
        Kiss my dick, hit my cash
        I'd rather have you whip my ass
        
        Don't put out? I'll put you out
        Won't get out? I'll push you out
        Puss blew out, poppin' shit
        Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
        Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
        Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
        What? You tryin' to be my new wife?
        What? You Mariah? Fly through twice
        
        But I do know one thing though
        Bitches, they come, they go
        Saturday through Sunday, Monday
        Monday through Sunday, yo
        Maybe I'll love you one day
        Maybe we'll someday grow
        'Til then just sit your drunk ass
        On that fuckin' runway, ho'
        
        I can't be your Superman
        Can't be your Superman
        Can't be your Superman
        Can't be your Superman
        I can't be your Superman
        Can't be your Superman
        Can't be your Superman
        Your Superman, your Superman
        
        Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
        It's no secret, everybody knows
        Yeah, we fucked, bitch, so what?
        That's about as far as your buddy goes
        
        We'll be friends, I'll call you again
        I'll chase you around every bar you attend
        Never know what kinda car I'll be in
        We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
        You don't want that, neither do I
        I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
        Too much pride between you and I
        Not a jealous man, but females lie
        But I guess that's just what sluts do
        How could it ever be just us two?
        I'd never love you enough to trust you
        We just met and I just fucked you
        
        But I do know one thing though
        Bitches, they come, they go
        Saturday through Sunday, Monday
        Monday through Sunday, yo

        Bitch, you make me hurl
        
        First thing you say: I'm not fazed
        I hang around big stars all day
        I don't see what the big deal is anyway
        You're just plain old Marshall to me
        Oh, yeah, girl, run that game
        Hailie Jade, I love that name
        Love that tattoo, what's that say?
        Rot In Pieces, uh, that's great
        
        First off, you don't know Marshall
        At all, so don't grow partial
        That's ammo for my arsenal
        I'll slap you off that bar stool
        There goes another lawsuit
        Leave handprints all across you
        Good Lordy, whoadie
        You must be gone off that water bottle
        
        You want what you can't have
        Oh, girl, that's too damn bad
        Don't touch what you can't grab
        End up with two backhands
        Put anthrax on a Tampax
        And slap you 'til you can't stand
        Girl, you just blew your chance
        Don't mean to ruin your plans
        
        But I do know one thing though
        Bitches, they come, they go
        Saturday through Sunday, Monday

        Can't be your Superman
        I can't be your Superman

         <div><h1>SIGNIFICADO DA <span>LETRA</span></h1></div>
         <div><h3>A música 'Superman', do rapper Eminem, com participação de Dina Rae, é uma faixa que explora as complexidades e frustrações das relações amorosas modernas, especialmente sob a perspectiva de uma celebridade. Eminem, conhecido por suas letras cruas e honestas, utiliza a metáfora do Superman para descrever a si mesmo como um homem desejado pelas mulheres, mas que, ao mesmo tempo, é incapaz de se comprometer ou se envolver emocionalmente de forma profunda.

            No decorrer da música, Eminem alterna entre momentos de aparente vulnerabilidade, onde ele expressa um desejo de amor e conexão ('I think I love you too'), e momentos de agressividade e desdém pelas mulheres que ele acredita estarem interessadas nele apenas por sua fama ('Bitch, you make me hurl'). A repetição do refrão 'I can't be your Superman' reforça a ideia de que, apesar de ser visto como um herói ou salvador pelas mulheres, ele se recusa a assumir esse papel em suas relações amorosas.
            
            A música também aborda temas como a promiscuidade, a desconfiança e a superficialidade nas interações entre homens e mulheres. Eminem critica a ideia de que as mulheres querem 'salvadores' e, ao mesmo tempo, expressa sua própria incapacidade de confiar e se entregar a um relacionamento ('I'd never love you enough to trust you'). A canção reflete a visão cínica do artista sobre o amor e os relacionamentos, uma visão que é frequentemente amplificada pela sua experiência como uma figura pública sujeita ao escrutínio e às expectativas do público e da mídia.</h3></div>
